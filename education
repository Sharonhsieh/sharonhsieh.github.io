						   Ok, this would probably be used as a blog or personal site, for the simple reason that it is not designed to
						   accomodate a vast amount of information. (Well, it can but you have to scroll a very long way...)
						   <p />
						   
						   No tables were used in this design, and it's pretty much as CSS-ed up as you can get. Feel free to use, hack
						   or mod this design, but mention who you got it from somewhere on the site (Chris, http://www.web-site.tk) and
						   leave the appropriate link in the source code. Email me if you use it! I'll help you too. Thanks! You can
						   pretty much do what you like otherwise...(apart from sell it, obviously)<p />
						   
						   On a separate note, due to the general rubbishness of some monitors, the colours are screwed up. There's
						   nothing I can do about that, so get over it!<p />
						   
						   This design works on all of the browsers ive tried it on - IE5, IE6, Mozilla, Opera and Netscape.<p />
						   						   
						   <div class="titleblock">a little about me</div>
						   
						   My real name is Chris Blunden, alias Vacant. According to some, I am incredibly sad - to those people I say
						   this: I don't care what you think. Noone cares what you think. Get on with your own life, instead of
						   critisising other people's. I spend most of the time on MSN (froggyb[at]gmail[dot]com). I guess that
						   doesn't really count as socialising? Thought not. Well, thats enough for the moment, if you want any help at
						   all with your template please, do email me. I'd be honoured. Why not email me anyway, if you use the design?
						   That'd make my day...
